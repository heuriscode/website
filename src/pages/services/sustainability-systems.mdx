Sustainability in economic development programs and economic policies has only become more important in recent years. Increasingly the communication of sustainability achievements is being seen as fraught with green-washing behaviours and thus is being reviewed to achieve better compliance and reliability. Additionally, policies and programs for development are being required to actually present evidence of environmental sustainability including in the pathways to impact.

Improving sustainability governance requires more than just a statement of intent or of concern. As sustainability concerns become more prominent it is becoming more important for enterprises, communities and governments to demonstrate achievements and investments and to do so in ways that can be verified by investors, residents/visitors and market regulators/actors. This is no easy task in the complex economic and social systems that are common in developed and developing countries alike.
